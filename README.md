# E-Commerce-Backend An Amzing Project
Django backend for eCommerce project

This project is built using Django REST Framework to provide the backend API for eCommerce project. The deployed API is available on [Heroku](https://ecommerce-backend-django.herokuapp.com/). The frontend is available [here](https://github.com/ncunx/ecommerce-frontend). 

Features
--------
1. Products API endpoint available at `/api/products/`.
2. Custom user authentication using JSON Web Tokens. The API is available at `/api/accounts/`.
2. Simple newsletter functionality: superuser can view the list of all subscribers in Django admin panel; any visitor can subscribe. The relevant API endpoint is available at `/api/newsletter/`.
3. [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) payments API endpoint available at `/api/payments/`.

Main requirements
------------

1. `python` 3.5, 3.6, 3.7
2. `Django` 2.1.8
3. `PostgreSQL` 11.1

This project also uses other packages (see `requirements.txt` file for details).
For instance, tag support is provided by [django-taggit](https://github.com/alex/django-taggit) and image processing is thanks to [Pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow).

## How to set up

### Setup using Docker

The easiest way to get backend up and running is via [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). See [docs](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) to get started. Once set up run the following command:

`docker-compose up`

This command takes care of populating products list with sample data.

It may take a while for the process to complete, as Docker needs to pull required dependencies. Once it is done, the application should be accessible at `0.0.0.0:8000`.

### Manual setup

Firstly, create a new directory and change to it:

`mkdir ecommerce-backend && cd ecommerce-backend`

Then, clone this repository to the current directory:

`git clone https://github.com/ncunx/ecommerce-backend.git .`


For the backend to work, one needs to setup database like SQLite or PostgreSQL on a local machine. This project uses PostgreSQL by default (see [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/settings/#databases) for different setup). This process may vary from one OS to another, eg. on Arch Linux one can follow a straightforward guide [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PostgreSQL).

The database settings are specified in `src/settings/local.py`. In particular the default database name is `eCommerceDjango`, which can be created from the PostgreSQL shell by running `createdb eCommerceDjango`.

Next, set up a virtual environment and activate it:

`python3 -m venv env && source env/bin/activate`

Install required packages:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Next, perform migration:

`python3 manage.py migrate --settings=src.settings.local`

At this point, one may want to create a superuser account and create some products. One can also use sample data provided in `products/fixtures.json` by running:

`python3 manage.py loaddata products/fixture.json --settings=src.settings.local`

The backend is now ready. Run a local server with

`python3 manage.py runserver --settings=src.settings.local`

The backend should be available at `localhost:8000`.

In order to use [Stripe payments](https://stripe.com/) one needs to create an account and obtain a pair of keys (available in the dashboard after signing in). These keys should replace `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` values in `src/settings/local.py`.

## To do

1. Implement an API endpoint at `/api/orders/` to accept POST request with order JSON from authenticated user, and GET requests from superuser (for further processing).
2. Implement password recovery.
